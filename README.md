# vplotter
Quick vplotter script written to control my daughters art robot school project.

This is written in python to control two stepper motors on a Raspberry Pi controlled my a Adafruit MotorHAT. The steppers are connected with a long timing belt with a heavy draw head in the center, forming a "V" shape, and the position of the head is calculated and positioned using pythagoras' theorum. 

Simple cardinal direction instructions are read from a file.
